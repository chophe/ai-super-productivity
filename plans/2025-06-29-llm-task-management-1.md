# LLM Task Management

## Objective

Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) to enable users to manage tasks using natural language prompts. The system will interpret prompts to create, delete, and manage tasks. A new text box will be introduced, triggered by the `/` character, to enter these prompts. The LLM will be configured with an API key.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create a new LLM service**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: This service will encapsulate the logic for interacting with the LLM API. It will handle API key management and prompt submission.
   - Files: `src/app/core/llm/llm.service.ts`, `src/app/core/llm/llm.model.ts`
   - Status: Not Started
2. **Integrate the LLM service into the task management module**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: The existing task management module will be modified to use the new LLM service. This will involve adding a new text input for prompts and connecting it to the service.
   - Files: `src/app/features/tasks/tasks.module.ts`, `src/app/features/tasks/add-task-bar/add-task-bar.component.ts`, `src/app/features/tasks/add-task-bar/add-task-bar.component.html`
   - Status: Not Started
3. **Implement prompt parsing and execution**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: The LLM service will parse the user's prompts and translate them into actions to be performed on the tasks. This will include creating, deleting, and updating tasks.
   - Files: `src/app/core/llm/llm.service.ts`
   - Status: Not Started
4. **Add a new text box for LLM prompts**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: A new text box will be added to the UI, which will be shown when the user types the `/` character. This text box will be used to enter prompts for the LLM.
   - Files: `src/app/features/tasks/add-task-bar/add-task-bar.component.html`, `src/app/features/tasks/add-task-bar/add-task-bar.component.ts`
   - Status: Not Started
5. **Implement API key management**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: A new section will be added to the settings page to allow users to configure their LLM API key. The API key will be securely stored.
   - Files: `src/app/features/config/global-config.model.ts`, `src/app/features/config/global-config.const.ts`, `src/app/features/config/config.module.ts`
   - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- The user can create a new task by typing a prompt like "/create a new task to buy milk".
- The user can delete a task by typing a prompt like "/delete the task to buy milk".
- The user can configure their LLM API key in the settings.
- The application correctly handles errors from the LLM API.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **LLM API changes**
   Mitigation: The LLM service will be designed to be easily adaptable to changes in the LLM API.
2. **Incorrect prompt parsing**
   Mitigation: The prompt parsing logic will be thoroughly tested to ensure it correctly interprets user prompts.
3. **Security of the API key**
   Mitigation: The API key will be stored securely using the platform's secure storage mechanisms.

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Use a different LLM provider**: We could use a different LLM provider if the chosen one does not meet our needs.
2. **Implement a more advanced prompt editor**: We could implement a more advanced prompt editor with features like syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
