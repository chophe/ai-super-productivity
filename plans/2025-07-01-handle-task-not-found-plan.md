# Plan: Handle "Task Not Found" Errors

**Objective:** To gracefully handle cases where a user tries to update a task that does not exist, providing a better user experience and clear error logging.

## 1. Problem Statement

When a user attempts to update a task that has been deleted or never existed, the system should not produce a generic or unhandled error. Instead, it should provide a clear, user-friendly message and log the event for developers to monitor.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

### 2.1. Verify Task Existence

Before attempting to update a task, the system should first verify that the task exists in the database.

*   **Action:** Query the database for the task ID provided in the update request.
*   **Expected Result:** The query will return the task if it exists, or `null`/`None` if it does not.

### 2.2. Return User-Friendly Error Message

If the task does not exist, the API should return a specific, user-friendly error message.

*   **API Response Code:** `404 Not Found`
*   **Response Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Task not found",
      "message": "The task you are trying to update does not exist. It may have been deleted."
    }
    ```

### 2.3. Log the Event

Log the "task not found" event for monitoring and debugging purposes.

*   **Log Level:** `WARN`
*   **Log Message:** `Attempted to update a non-existent task.`
*   **Log Data:**
    *   `taskId`: The ID of the task that was not found.
    *   `userId`: The ID of the user who made the request.
    *   `timestamp`: The time of the event.

## 3. Success Metrics

*   **Reduced Unhandled Errors:** A significant decrease in the number of unhandled exceptions or generic 500 errors in the logs related to task updates.
*   **Improved User Feedback:** Positive feedback from users or a decrease in support tickets related to confusion about failed task updates.
*   **Effective Monitoring:** The ability to track how often this issue occurs through log analysis.

---

## 4. Technical Considerations

*   **Database Performance:** The initial check for the task's existence should be a lightweight and fast query to avoid performance degradation.
*   **API Consistency:** The error response format should be consistent with other API error responses.
*   **Localization:** If the application supports multiple languages, the error message should be localized.

---

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

*   **Risk:** The additional database query could slightly increase the latency of the update operation.
    *   **Mitigation:** This impact is expected to be negligible, but it should be monitored after deployment. Caching strategies could be employed if necessary.
