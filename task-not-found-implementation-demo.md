# Task Not Found Error Handling Implementation Demo

## Overview
This implementation successfully handles "task not found" errors when attempting to update non-existent tasks, providing better user experience and monitoring capabilities.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Reducer Logging
**File:** `src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared-meta-reducers/task-shared-crud.reducer.ts`

Added comprehensive logging when a task update fails due to task not found:
```typescript
if (!currentTask) {
  // Log the task not found event for monitoring and debugging
  console.warn('Attempted to update a non-existent task.', {
    taskId,
    changes: taskUpdate.changes,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
  return state;
}
```

### 2. User-Friendly Error Notification Effect
**File:** `src/app/features/tasks/store/task-ui.effects.ts`

Added a new effect that detects when updateTask actions fail due to missing tasks:
```typescript
taskNotFoundError$ = createEffect(
  () =>
    this._actions$.pipe(
      ofType(TaskSharedActions.updateTask),
      withLatestFrom(this._store$),
      filter(([{ task }, state]) => {
        const taskId = task.id as string;
        return !state.tasks.entities[taskId];
      }),
      tap(([{ task }]) => {
        const taskId = task.id as string;
        this._snackService.open({
          type: 'ERROR',
          msg: T.F.TASK.S.TASK_NOT_FOUND,
          translateParams: { taskId },
          ico: 'error',
        });
      }),
    ),
  { dispatch: false },
);
```

### 3. Translation Support
**Files:** 
- `src/app/t.const.ts` - Added translation constant
- `src/assets/i18n/en.json` - Added English translation

Added user-friendly error message:
```json
"TASK_NOT_FOUND": "The task you are trying to update does not exist. It may have been deleted."
```

## How It Works

1. **User attempts to update a task** that doesn't exist (e.g., through API, plugin, or UI)

2. **Reducer handles the update gracefully:**
   - Checks if task exists in state
   - If not found, logs detailed warning with taskId, changes, and timestamp
   - Returns unchanged state (no crash)

3. **Effect detects the failed update:**
   - Monitors all updateTask actions
   - Checks if the target task exists in the store
   - If task not found, shows user-friendly error snackbar

4. **User sees clear error message:**
   - Red error snackbar appears
   - Message: "The task you are trying to update does not exist. It may have been deleted."
   - Includes error icon for visual clarity

## Benefits

✅ **User Experience:** Clear, actionable error messages instead of silent failures
✅ **Monitoring:** Structured logging for developers to track frequency and patterns
✅ **Reliability:** No crashes or undefined behavior when tasks are missing
✅ **Debugging:** Detailed logs include taskId, attempted changes, and timestamp
✅ **Internationalization:** Supports multiple languages through translation system

## Success Metrics

- **Reduced Unhandled Errors:** No more silent failures when updating non-existent tasks
- **Improved User Feedback:** Users now understand what went wrong and why
- **Effective Monitoring:** Developers can track how often this issue occurs through console logs
- **Better Error Handling:** Graceful degradation instead of application crashes

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage to verify:
- Error snackbar appears when updating non-existent tasks
- No error shown when updating existing tasks
- Proper logging occurs in all scenarios
- Translation system works correctly

This implementation fully addresses the requirements outlined in the original plan and provides a robust solution for handling "task not found" scenarios.
